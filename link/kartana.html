        <p>Kartana is a small Ultra Beast that resembles an origami human. It appears to be folded out of a sheet of paper which is white on one side and orange on the other. Its head is folded slightly inside its body and has a four-sided star in the center, but no discernible facial features. Its head opens and closes similar to a paper fortune teller and seems to function as both an eye and a mouth. On top of its head are two short antennae or horns that are wider at the top. It has long, thin arms that resemble katanas with a yellow, sheath-like structure around the upper area. The sheath connects to a red, slightly raised hexagon on its torso. Extending up and out from the base of each sheath are three yellow projections that are nearly as long as its arms. Its legs appear creased with areas of red visible along the edges. Kartana's light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence.</p>

        <p>Despite its small size compared to the other Ultra Beasts, Kartana is extremely dangerous, as every edge of its body is incredibly sharp. It is able to cut down a gigantic steel tower with one stroke of the blades on its arms, and any opponents that try to attack it will be similarly cut apart. According to Wicke of the Aether Foundation, its light, paper-like body allows it to evade most attacks by simply floating out of the way, but it also makes it highly vulnerable to fire and moisture. As seen in the anime, Kartana can open Ultra Wormholes and has the ability to speak, only backwards. For a brief time, it was the only Pokémon that could learn Cut by leveling up.</p><br>
