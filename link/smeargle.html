                <p>Smeargle is best known for its ability to use the move Sketch, which permanently copies the last move used by the opponent. Due to this, it can legitimately have any move in the Pokémon games except for Chatter, Struggle, and Shadow moves — though it can learn Dark Void and Hyperspace Fury, it cannot use those moves as they can only be used by specific Pokémon. As a result of this, it can pass on any Egg Move to Pokémon in the Field Egg Group.</p>

                <p>Smeargle is a bipedal, beagle-like Pokémon with white and brown fur. It has a long tail with an end resembling a paintbrush. This paintbrush oozes with paint, and the color of the paint may vary for each Smeargle, as well as change in hue corresponding to its emotions. Sprites from the games depict green, brown, and red, while the anime also shows yellow and blue. Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is the same color as the tip of the tail. The mark is placed on Smeargle's back as a sign of adulthood.</p><br>
                <p>Smeargle also has a round structure on its head with a point that resembles a beret. It has floppy, brown ears and a brown collar on its neck. The rings encircling Smeargle's eyes are also brown, as are Smeargle's eyelids. Its arms have two brown bands, and its legs have only one. Each of its limbs has three digits.</p><br>
                <p>Smeargle uses its paint to mark its territory. There are over 5,000 known different marks that Smeargle uses. There are Smeargle fanatics who will pay big money for owning one. It can also use its signature move, Sketch, to copy moves from other Pokémon. Smeargle is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sketch. Smeargle is often found in urban areas filled with graffiti.</p><br>
