                    <img src="img/smeargle.png"><p>Smeargle is best known for its ability to use the move Sketch, which permanently copies the last move used by the opponent. Due to this, it can legitimately have any move in the Pokémon games except for Chatter, Struggle, and Shadow moves — though it can learn Dark Void and Hyperspace Fury, it cannot use those moves as they can only be used by specific Pokémon. As a result of this, it can pass on any Egg Move to Pokémon in the Field Egg Group.<a href="link/smeargle.html"> More..</a></p>

                    <img src="img/gbb.webp"><p>When a Greninja with Battle Bond directly causes another Pokémon (including allies) to faint by using a damaging move, unless this ends the battle, it will change into Ash-Greninja. After the battle, the Pokémon reverts to its original form.
                        Ash-Greninja has higher base stats than regular Greninja. If Ash-Greninja uses Water Shuriken, the move's power becomes 20 (rather than the usual 15) and it always hits three times. If a Pokémon Transforms into Ash-Greninja, Battle Bond does not affect the transformed Pokémon's use of Water Shuriken.<a href="link/greninja.html"> More..</a></p>

                    <img src="img/mewtwo.png"><p>According to the scientific logs found in the Pokémon Mansion of Cinnabar Island, Mewtwo was born from a pregnant Mew, found deep in the jungles of Guyana, whose embryo had been tampered with to alter its DNA. It was held and studied in the mansion where a scientist performed horrific gene-splicing experiments that made it vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free of the Mansion, destroying it in the process, and fled. It can be encountered in Cerulean Cave, accessible only after a Trainer has proven their skill at the Indigo Plateau.<a href="link/mewtwo.html"> More..</a></p>

                    <img src="img/kartana.webp"><p>Kartana debuted in Living on the Cutting Edge!, appearing in Alola through an Ultra Wormhole. It started slicing through various objects across Melemele Island, prompting Ash and his classmates to embark on their eighth mission as the Ultra Guardians. Their efforts to catch it ended in failure and were soon overshadowed by a meteor falling towards the Pokémon School. Unexpectedly, Kartana sliced the meteor into small, harmless pieces before it could hit the building, saving the school from being damaged. Afterwards, it created itself a new Ultra Wormhole by repeatedly slicing the air in rapid succession, and then returned itself home.<a href="link/kartana.html"> More..</a></p>
